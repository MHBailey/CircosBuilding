# CircosBuilding

### Objectives

For many projects, I have been tasked to visualize genomics data.  Here is a compilation of object-oriented python scripts that I used to characterize and format my data to comply with the circos building platform found online at circos.ca (written by Martin Krzywinski).

### Pre and post processing of these data required

Here I give viewers a taste of the code I can write to process and format data as necessary.
